# What Is Mimikatz?


Mimikatz is an open-source hacking tool that extracts credential information from compromised machines. 

It was created by Benjamin Delpy as a proof of concept to highlight how Microsoft authentication protocols, like Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM), were vulnerable to attacks. 
Mimikatz is an old tool heavily used by penetration testers, red teamers, and real-world hackers. As such, sophisticated detections and mitigations have been built into security tools and even the Windows operating system that can catch Mimikatz and block it. 

If you just download and run Mimikatz on a machine running Windows 10+, you will not be successful; Microsoft Defender will block it, and you will fail. 

However, there are ways you can get Mimikatz to run. Firstly, as discussed previously, you must run it with administrative privileges or system-level ones. Secondly, you must incorporate defense evasion tactics and techniques to bypass security mechanisms

That said, these evasion techniques fall outside the scope of this article and wonâ€™t be used in the following demonstrations. Instead, you will see Mimkatz executed on disk on a Windows machine that has anti-virus and malware protections disabled.

## Step 1: Disable  Windows Security 

Taking into consideration that we are in a post-exploitation phase of an attack. This phase begins after you successfully compromise a machine and gain unauthorized access.  

To disable Real-Time Protection in Windows using Command Prompt, run this command in an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell session:

```bash
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

## Step 2: Download Mimikatz and run the exploit 


Open the web browser on your Virtual Machine. Navigate to this directory to download Mimikatz https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/tag/2.2.0-20220919



Once the file has been downloaded and unzipped, the security is disabled. 

Open a PowerShell prompt as an admin and run the following command

```bash
#Navigate to the mimikatz_trunk directory
cd $FIlEPATH$
```
